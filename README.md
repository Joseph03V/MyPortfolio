## Description
This is a my react portfolio that displays all my projects and tells you my proficiencies.

## Instalation
To install this server all you have to do is, fork my repository. Then in a terminal do a "npm install". Once that is completed all you have to do is type "npm run start" in the terminal. This starts up the server and allows you to start using the routes to fill in your data.
